# TypeMart
    small project from CodeAcademy to learn TypeScript

While I was going through Learn Typescript course on CodeAcademy I decided to duplicate it using Visual Studio Code + Github

As result I learned how to:
- create repositories
- commit changes
- install all dependencies on my mac (for further TypeScript projects)
- comment my code for better and deeper understanding
